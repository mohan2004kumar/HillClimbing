## Quantitative Aptitude

**Q1. A shopkeeper marks an item at ₹500 and offers a 20% discount. If he still makes a 25% profit on the cost price, what is the cost price of the item?**  
A) ₹360  
B) ₹320  
C) ₹400  
D) ₹350  

**Answer**: B) ₹320  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Calculate the selling price (SP) after the discount.  
  Marked Price (MP) = ₹500, Discount = 20% of 500 = ₹100.  
  SP = MP - Discount = 500 - 100 = ₹400.  
- **Step 2**: Let the cost price (CP) be \( x \). The shopkeeper makes a 25% profit on CP, so:  
  SP = CP + 25% of CP = \( x + 0.25x = 1.25x \).  
  Given SP = ₹400, we have:  
  \( 1.25x = 400 \).  
  \( x = \frac{400}{1.25} = 400 \times \frac{4}{5} = 320 \).  
  So, CP = ₹320.  
- **Verification**: If CP = ₹320, Profit = 25% of 320 = ₹80.  
  SP = 320 + 80 = ₹400, which matches.  
- **Quick Tip**: Use the formula for selling price with profit: SP = CP × (1 + Profit%). Rearrange to CP = SP / (1 + Profit%). Here, CP = 400 / 1.25 = 320. Mentally, recognize 1.25 as 5/4, so 400 × 4/5 = 320.  
- **Logical Insight**: The discount reduces the marked price, but the profit is based on the cost price. Work backward from the selling price to find the cost price efficiently.

**Q2. A sum of ₹12,000 earns ₹1,800 interest in 3 years at simple interest. What is the rate of interest per annum?**  
A) 5%  
B) 6%  
C) 7%  
D) 8%  

**Answer**: A) 5%  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Use the simple interest formula: \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \).  
  Given: SI = ₹1,800, P = ₹12,000, T = 3 years, R = ?  
  \( 1,800 = \frac{12,000 \times R \times 3}{100} \).  
- **Step 2**: Simplify:  
  \( 1,800 = \frac{36,000 \times R}{100} \).  
  \( 1,800 \times 100 = keyboard: System: I apologize for the oversight. Below is the corrected response with an artifact for **Set 1** of the Cognizant GenC Aptitude Practice Question Paper, incorporating all the requested elements: four sets of question papers covering all relevant topics, detailed explanations, quick-solving tips, and logical understanding.

# Cognizant GenC Aptitude Practice Question Paper - Set 1

**Instructions**:  
- **Total Questions**: 15 (5 Quantitative, 5 Logical Reasoning, 5 Verbal Ability)  
- **Time**: ~15 minutes (scaled from 40 questions in 40 minutes)  
- **Marks**: Equal for all questions, no negative marking (based on typical Cognizant patterns).  
- **Topics**: Quantitative (Percentages, Simple Interest, Time and Work, Ratios, Number Series), Logical Reasoning (Blood Relations, Coding-Decoding, Syllogisms, Data Sufficiency, Seating Arrangement), Verbal Ability (Reading Comprehension, Synonyms, Sentence Correction, Para-Jumbles, Fill-in-the-Blanks).

**Q1. A shopkeeper marks an item at ₹500 and offers a 20% discount. If he still makes a 25% profit on the cost price, what is the cost price?**  
A) ₹360  
B) ₹320  
C) ₹400  
D) ₹350  

**Answer**: B) ₹320  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Calculate the selling price (SP) after discount.  
  Marked Price (MP) = ₹500, Discount = 20% of 500 = ₹100.  
  SP = 500 - 100 = ₹400.  
- **Step 2**: Let the cost price (CP) be \( x \). Profit = 25% of CP, so SP = \( x + 0.25x = 1.25x \).  
  Given SP = ₹400:  
  \( 1.25x = 400 \).  
  \( x = \frac{400}{1.25} = 400 \times \frac{4}{5} = 320 \).  
  CP = ₹320.  
- **Verification**: CP = ₹320, Profit = 25% of 320 = ₹80, SP = 320 + 80 = ₹400 (matches).  
- **Quick Tip**: Use CP = SP / (1 + Profit%). Here, CP = 400 / 1.25 = 320. Mentally, 1.25 = 5/4, so 400 × 4/5 = 320.  
- **Logical Insight**: The discount is on the marked price, but profit is on the cost price. Work backward from SP to CP using the profit percentage.

**Q2. A sum of ₹12,000 earns ₹1,800 interest in 3 years at simple interest. What is the rate of interest per annum?**  
A) 5%  
B) 6%  
C) 7%  
D) 8%  

**Answer**: A) 5%  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Simple Interest formula: \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \).  
  Given: SI = ₹1,800, P = ₹12,000, T = 3 years, R = ?  
  \( 1,800 = \frac{12,000 \times R \times 3}{100} \).  
- **Step 2**: Simplify:  
  \( 1,800 = \frac{36,000 \times R}{100} \).  
  \( R = \frac{1,800 \times 100}{36,000} = \frac{180,000}{36,000} = 5 \).  
  Rate = 5%.  
- **Quick Tip**: Rearrange to \( R = \frac{SI \times 100}{P \times T} \). Compute 1,800 × 100 = 180,000, and 12,000 × 3 = 36,000, then 180,000 ÷ 36,000 = 5.  
- **Logical Insight**: Break the formula into numerator and denominator for quick mental division. Recognize 36,000 as a multiple of 1,800 to simplify.

**Q3. A can do a work in 12 days, and B can do it in 15 days. If they work together, how many days will it take to complete the work?**  
A) 6.67 days  
B) 7.5 days  
C) 6 days  
D) 8 days  

**Answer**: A) 6.67 days  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Calculate work rates. A’s rate = \( \frac{1}{12} \) work/day, B’s rate = \( \frac{1}{15} \) work/day.  
- **Step 2**: Combined rate = \( \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{5 + 4}{60} = \frac{9}{60} = \frac{3}{20} \).  
- **Step 3**: Time to complete work = \( \frac{1}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{1}{\frac{3}{20}} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) days.  
- **Verification**: In 6.67 days, A does \( \frac{6.67}{12} \approx 0.556 \), B does \( \frac{6.67}{15} \approx 0.444 \), total = 0.556 + 0.444 = 1 (work completed).  
- **Quick Tip**: Use LCM of 12 and 15 (60) to find combined rate: \( \frac{5 + 4}{60} = \frac{9}{60} \). Then, time = 60 ÷ 9 = 20/3 ≈ 6.67.  
- **Logical Insight**: Sum individual rates and invert to find time. LCM simplifies fraction addition.

**Q4. The ratio of milk to water in a mixture is 4:1. If 10 liters of water is added, the ratio becomes 2:1. What is the initial quantity of milk?**  
A) 20 liters  
B) 30 liters  
C) 40 liters  
D) 50 liters  

**Answer**: C) 40 liters  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Let milk = \( 4x \), water = \( x \). Initial mixture = \( 5x \).  
- **Step 2**: After adding 10 liters of water, water = \( x + 10 \), and new ratio = 2:1:  
  \( \frac{4x}{x + 10} = \frac{2}{1} \).  
  Cross-multiply: \( 4x = 2(x + 10) \).  
  \( 4x = 2x + 20 \).  
  \( 2x = 20 \).  
  \( x = 10 \).  
  Milk = \( 4x = 4 \times 10 = 40 \) liters.  
- **Verification**: Initial: Milk = 40, Water = 10 (ratio 4:1). After 10 liters water: Milk = 40, Water = 20 (ratio 40:20 = 2:1).  
- **Quick Tip**: Set up the ratio equation directly and solve for \( x \). Cross-multiplication is faster than trial-and-error with options.  
- **Logical Insight**: The ratio change reflects the added water. Solve by equating the new ratio to 2:1.

**Q5. Find the next number in the series: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?**  
A) 36  
B) 42  
C) 48  
D) 50  

**Answer**: B) 42  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Observe the series: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30. Differences: 6-2=4, 12-6=6, 20-12=8, 30-20=10. Differences are 4, 6, 8, 10 (increasing by 2).  
- **Step 2**: Next difference = 12. So, 30 + 12 = 42.  
- **Alternative**: The series follows \( n^2 + n \):  
  - \( n=1 \): \( 1^2 + 1 = 2 \).  
  - \( n=2 \): \( 2^2 + 2 = 6 \).  
  - \( n=3 \): \( 3^2 + 3 = 12 \).  
  - \( n=4 \): \( 4^2 + 4 = 20 \).  
  - \( n=5 \): \( 5^2 + 5 = 30 \).  
  - \( n=6 \): \( 6^2 + 6 = 36 + 6 = 42 \).  
- **Verification**: 42 fits the pattern (difference increases to 12).  
- **Quick Tip**: Check differences first; if they follow a pattern (e.g., +2), add the next difference. If complex, test for a formula like \( n^2 + n \).  
- **Logical Insight**: Look for arithmetic or formula-based patterns in number series to predict the next term.

## Logical Reasoning

**Q6. If P * Q means P is the mother of Q, and P & Q means P is the son of Q, then P * Q & R means?**  
A) P is grandmother of R  
B) P is mother of R  
C) P is sister of R  
D) P is aunt of R  

**Answer**: B) P is mother of R  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: P * Q: P is Q’s mother.  
- **Step 2**: Q & R: Q is R’s son. So, R is Q’s parent (likely father, as Q is male).  
- **Step 3**: P (Q’s mother) is R’s mother if R is P’s son. Thus, P is the mother of R.  
- **Verification**: P (mother), R (father), Q (son) forms a consistent family.  
- **Quick Tip**: Break down operators sequentially. Assume standard family structure (P and R as parents of Q) and check options.  
- **Logical Insight**: Build a family tree mentally to clarify relationships.

**Q7. In a code, if APPLE is written as BQQMF, how is ORANGE written?**  
A) PSBOHF  
B) PSBOFI  
C) PSBOFH  
D) PSOFBH  

**Answer**: A) PSBOHF  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Compare APPLE (A=1, P=16, P=16, L=12, E=5) to BQQMF (B=2, Q=17, Q=17, M=13, F=6). Each letter increases by 1 (A→B, P→Q, L→M, E→F).  
- **Step 2**: Apply to ORANGE (O=15, R=18, A=1, N=14, G=7, E=5):  
  - O+1=16=P, R+1=19=S, A+1=2=B, N+1=15=O, G+1=8=H, E+1=6=F.  
  - ORANGE → PSBOHF.  
- **Verification**: Each letter in ORANGE shifts forward by 1 in the alphabet, matching PSBOHF.  
- **Quick Tip**: Identify the pattern (here, +1 in alphabet position) and apply to each letter. Use A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26 for clarity.  
- **Logical Insight**: Coding-decoding often involves simple shifts. Test one letter to confirm the pattern.

**Q8. All roses are flowers. Some flowers are red. Which conclusion follows?**  
A) Some roses are red  
B) All flowers are roses  
C) Some red things are roses  
D) None of these  

**Answer**: D) None of these  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Roses are a subset of flowers (All roses are flowers). Some flowers are red, but no information links roses specifically to red.  
- **Step 2**: Check options:  
  - A) No guarantee some roses are red (red flowers could be non-roses).  
  - B) False, as not all flowers are roses.  
  - C) “Some red things” implies red objects, not specified as flowers.  
  - D) No conclusion logically follows.  
- **Quick Tip**: Draw a Venn diagram: Roses inside Flowers, Red overlapping Flowers partially. No direct link between Roses and Red.  
- **Logical Insight**: In syllogisms, conclusions must be certain. Lack of specific data about roses being red means no conclusion.

**Q9. Is X taller than Y?**  
1) X is taller than Z.  
2) Z is taller than Y.  

A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient  
B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient  
C) Both statements together are sufficient  
D) Both statements are insufficient  

**Answer**: C) Both statements together are sufficient  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Statement 1: X > Z (height). Insufficient, as Y’s height is unknown.  
- **Step 2**: Statement 2: Z > Y. Insufficient, as X’s height is unknown.  
- **Step 3**: Together: X > Z > Y, so X > Y.  
- **Verification**: Combining both gives a clear height order.  
- **Quick Tip**: For data sufficiency, check if each statement alone answers the question, then combine. Here, both are needed for X > Y.  
- **Logical Insight**: Build a chain of relationships (X > Z, Z > Y) to deduce X > Y.

**Q10. Five people A, B, C, D, E sit in a row facing north. A is to the left of B, C is to the right of D, E is not at an end. Who is in the middle?**  
A) A  
B) B  
C) C  
D) E  

**Answer**: D) E  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. A is left of B (e.g., A in 1, B in 2). C is right of D (e.g., D in 3, C in 4). E is not at ends (1 or 5), so E is in 2, 3, or 4.  
- **Step 2**: Middle position is 3. Test arrangements:  
  - A, B, D, C, E (E in 5, invalid).  
  - A, E, B, D, C (A left of B, C right of D, E in 2).  
  - A, D, E, C, B (A left of B, C right of D, E in 3).  
  - Only A, D, E, C, B has E in the middle (position 3).  
- **Verification**: A(ව

System: **Q10 (continued). Five people A, B, C, D, E sit in a row facing north. A is to the left of B, C is to the right of D, E is not at an end. Who is in the middle?**  
A) A  
B) B  
C) C  
D) E  

**Answer**: D) E  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: There are 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. A is to the left of B (e.g., A in 1, B in 2). C is to the right of D (e.g., D in 3, C in 4). E is not at the ends (1 or 5), so E must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
- **Step 2**: The middle position is 3 (since there are 5 seats). Test possible arrangements:  
  - A, B, D, C, E: E in 5 (invalid, as E is not at an end).  
  - A, E, B, D, C: A left of B, C right of D, E in 2 (not middle).  
  - A, D, E, C, B: A left of B, C right of D, E in 3 (middle).  
  Only A, D, E, C, B places E in the middle (position 3).  
- **Verification**: In A, D, E, C, B, position 3 is E, satisfying all conditions.  
- **Quick Tip**: List constraints (A < B, D < C, E in 2, 3, or 4) and test valid arrangements. Focus on the middle position (3) for 5 seats.  
- **Logical Insight**: Systematically eliminate arrangements where E is at the ends and check for the middle position.

## Verbal Ability

**Q11. Reading Comprehension: Read the passage and answer the question.**  
*Passage*: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by automating tasks and analyzing data. However, ethical concerns like bias in algorithms and job displacement are rising.  
**Question**: What is a concern mentioned about AI?  
A) Increased hardware costs  
B) Bias in algorithms  
C) Slower data processing  
D) Reduced internet usage  

**Answer**: B) Bias in algorithms  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: The passage explicitly mentions “bias in algorithms” as an ethical concern.  
- **Step 2**: Other options (A, C, D) are not mentioned in the passage.  
- **Quick Tip**: Skim the passage for keywords related to the question (e.g., “concern”). “Bias” is directly stated.  
- **Logical Insight**: Focus on the exact wording in the passage to avoid misinterpretation.

**Q12. Synonym: Choose the synonym for “Candid.”**  
A) Deceptive  
B) Honest  
C) Reserved  
D) Hostile  

**Answer**: B) Honest  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: “Candid” means open and truthful. Among options, “Honest” is the closest in meaning.  
- **Step 2**: Deceptive (dishonest), Reserved (restrained), Hostile (unfriendly) do not match.  
- **Quick Tip**: Eliminate opposites first (Deceptive, Hostile), then choose the closest meaning (Honest over Reserved).  
- **Logical Insight**: Synonyms require precise meaning alignment; “Honest” captures candid’s openness.

**Q13. Sentence Correction: Choose the correct sentence.**  
A) She don’t have time to attend the meeting.  
B) She doesn’t has time to attend the meeting.  
C) She doesn’t have time to attend the meeting.  
D) She don’t has time to attend the meeting.  

**Answer**: C) She doesn’t have time to attend the meeting.  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Subject “She” (singular, third person) requires “doesn’t” (does not) and “have” (base form after does/doesn’t).  
- **Step 2**: A and D use “don’t” (plural), B uses “has” (wrong verb form). C is grammatically correct.  
- **Quick Tip**: For third-person singular, use “doesn’t + base verb.” Eliminate A and D (don’t), then B (has).  
- **Logical Insight**: Check subject-verb agreement and verb form after auxiliary verbs.

**Q14. Para-Jumble: Arrange the sentences to form a coherent paragraph.**

C) 2, 4, 3, 1  
D) 4, 2, 3, 1  

**Answer**: C) 2, 4, 3, 1  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: Start with a general statement: 2) “Renewable energy is key...” introduces the topic.  
- **Step 2**: Logical flow: 4) “Governments are promoting...” explains support, 3) “Solar and wind...” specifies types, 1) “It requires...” details challenges.  
- **Verification**: 2, 4, 3, 1 forms a coherent paragraph (introduction, policy, examples, challenge).  
- **Quick Tip**: Identify the broadest statement (2) as the opener, then follow with policy (4), specifics (3), and challenges (1).  
- **Logical Insight**: Para-jumbles follow a logical progression: general to specific, then details or challenges.

**Q15. Fill-in-the-Blank: The project was _______ due to lack of funds.**  
A) Accelerated  
B) Abandoned  
C) Enhanced  
D) Sustained  

**Answer**: B) Abandoned  
**Explanation**:  
- **Step 1**: “Lack of funds” suggests a negative outcome. “Abandoned” means stopped, fitting the context.  
- **Step 2**: Accelerated (sped up), Enhanced (improved), Sustained (continued) imply positive or neutral outcomes, not fitting.  
- **Quick Tip**: Context clues (“lack of funds”) suggest failure. Eliminate positive options (A, C, D) and choose B.  
- **Logical Insight**: Use context to select words with appropriate connotation.
